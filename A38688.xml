            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis is not therefore, Great Sir, to beg your Patronage for this Book, nor for my ſelf: but rather to direct you to the <hi>Light of ſalvation, Luk.</hi> 1.17. and to make it <hi>ſhine</hi> to you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. leſt you <hi>loſe</hi> here your Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and after your Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>for lack of knowledge,</hi> Hoſ. 4.6. for though I ſeem angry with ſome men for Religion, I am ſo far from
<pb facs="tcp:40429:3"/>hating a man for his Religion, that I look upon him, as he <hi>whom the Son of man came to ſave,</hi> Mat. 18.11. a fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my love and charity; and as <hi>a wounded man, who needs me</hi> (that am neither Prieſt, Miniſter, nor Levite) for his <hi>Friend, Luk.</hi> 10.30, 37. and <hi>Phyſician, Mat.</hi> 9.12. And therefore I am ſo much farther from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd againſt Your Highneſs for yours, with the Epidemical diſtemper, though it wants not a Preſident in Scripture, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.13, 14. that Your Highneſs is one of <hi>the powers</hi> of this Land, whom I am bound to honour, and that <hi>for the Oath of God,</hi> Rom. 13.1, 2.

And becauſe men of the World are very unwilling to acknowledge that it is the immediate hand of God, the firſt time they are ſmitten, and attribute the cauſe to ſome fault or accident; as the men of <hi>Benhadad</hi> when they had been defeated, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.23. who ſaid, their Gods being Gods of the hills, have given them this advantage
<pb facs="tcp:40429:7"/>in the hills, <hi>but if we fight with them in the plain,</hi> or the Valleys, <hi>we ſhall be ſtronger than they;</hi> therefore God, to make them know that it is he that doth it, brings (as upon <hi>Benhadad</hi>) upon them the ſecond time an entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Sir, There is no greater ſin laid to the charge of a Prince, (who is born in, and pretends to the Covenant of God) than that of his ignorance and ungratefulneſs to God; which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the ſin and way of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who thought by eſtabliſhing in his Kingdom a worſhip altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the true worſhip of God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.28. <hi>John</hi> 4.24. to preſerve it for himſelf and for his Poſterity, but loſt it, and deſtroyed his Poſterity by it. The ſame thing got <hi>Gideon</hi> by the <hi>Ephod</hi> which he made; for it became (ſaith <hi>Eſdras,</hi> Judg. 8.27.) ſuch ſnare
<pb facs="tcp:40429:8"/>unto his houſe, that his threeſcore and ten Sons were all at once caught in it, <hi>ch.</hi> 9.5. and ſuch an evil Spirit of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding (as is now between your Highneſs, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People) was ſent between his Baſtard, and thoſe who had choſe him King, <hi>v.</hi> 23. that they carried it not far, but were ſoon after ſo faſt entangled in the ſame ſnare, that they utterly cut off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed one another. By the revolts of Subjects, the Princes ſins againſt God are commonly puniſhed: and nothing makes Princes more potent and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, than when they themſelves ſerve God, their King and Maſter, in Truth.</p>
            <p>Do ſo then; riſe from darkneſs to light; convert your ſelf, Sir, to the true God of all fleſh; and when you are converted, ſet up a ſtrong purpoſe to promote his Spiritual Kingdom, with
<pb facs="tcp:40429:8"/>all your power: and thoſe very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that would not have you to reign over them, ſhall be your Friends: and ſhall, as they did before at your former return, meet you with Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and become your dutiful Subjects; and continue ſuch as long as you continue dutiful to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. <hi>God give you underſtanding that you may ſerve him and live:</hi> as it was the prayer of a wiſe King for himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.34, 144. ſo it ſhall be mine for you: and that the Earth may be full of the knowledge of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. under you, if you outlive and ſucceed his Majeſty.</p>

               <p>GOD forbid that I ſhould revile or cenſure the leaſt of the Miniſters of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. (as ſome will with the Vicar of <hi>Weſt-ham,</hi> pag. 22. be apt to ſay I do) for then I could not but fear ſome ſuch puniſhment as fell upon thoſe Children who reviled <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.25. But God forbid alſo that I ſhould look upon ſome men as God's Miniſters, becauſe they count themſelves ſuch, <hi>Job</hi> 32.21, 22. for then I muſt needs be ſitting in the ſame ſhadow of death, (ignorance of God, <hi>John</hi> 17.3.) and in danger to lye down at laſt in the ſame ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. as they that know God only by hear-ſay, and worſhip him, in ſhews, with their mouth and lips. The means to avoid miſtakes in this, is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning and trying of the Spirits: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a faculty, that St. <hi>John</hi> takes for granted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40429:10"/>all thoſe he writ his firſt general Epiſtle to, that is, all true Believers, have already, or may have, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.1. (and they <hi>being made by Christ, Priests,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.6. — 5.10. may pretend to the Prieſts right <hi>to diſcern and to pronounce what is clean, and</hi> what <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, Levit.</hi> 13.17, 23.) I hope, by the mercy of God, it belongs to me. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope, that if after having tryed and found that ſome men have not in them the Spirit of Chriſt, and ſhewed ſufficient reaſons and very good grounds for it, I pronounce them to be none of the Miniſters of God, I ſhall not go for a <hi>Reviler</hi> of ſuch.</p>
               <p>And truly I have tryed and found, that not only ſome few men among Chriſtians have not the Spirit of Chriſt, but that ſo many are <hi>the falſe ſeducing Spirits gone abroad into the World,</hi> 1 John 4.1. to deny <hi>that Chriſt cometh to men</hi> whilſt yet <hi>in the fleſh, which Spirits are not of God,</hi> v. 3. and <hi>to ſpeak,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 Tim. 4.2. <hi>their lies in Hypocriſie:</hi> that the true Doctrine of Chriſt, and the two Witneſſes that do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie of him, ſeem like to <hi>be overcome, Revel.</hi> 11.7. nay <hi>to be killed</hi> by them; nothing but their <hi>carcaſſes,</hi> the dead letter of Scripture,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40429:10"/>and a dead ineffectual notion of the Holy Ghoſt, ſeeming now left unburied, <hi>lying in the Streets of the Spiritual Sodom,</hi> that is, the preſent Chriſtian Churches, <hi>v.</hi> 8. For what elſe is allowed them, and diſpenced among their Members by their own Prophets? for inſtance, by the Author of a late Sermon preached at the Viſitation of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and by all them that approve, hold and teach the ſame Doctrine? who are come to that height of inſolence in denying the power and exiſtence of God's Spirit in his Church, <hi>in changing the truth of God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it <hi>into lies, holding in unrighteouſneſs that which may be known of</hi> it, Rom. 1.18, 19, 25. that I think it high time for them <hi>who make mention of the Lord, not to keep ſilence,</hi> Iſa. 62.6. but with the Rod of their mouth to ſmite all theſe Seducers by whom offences do come, that <hi>the ſimple may beware,</hi> and <hi>learn</hi> to come without them to <hi>the knowledge of the truth,</hi> Prov. 19.25.</p>
               <p>For my part I declare, that reading the ſaid Sermon my Spirit was <hi>ſo ſtirred up,</hi> Acts 17.16. that, having (like <hi>Flihu,</hi> Job 32.11.) <hi>given ear to their reaſons whilſt they ſearched out what to ſay, and waited</hi> a good while <hi>for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40429:11"/>an anſwer</hi> to them from ſome wiſer than my ſelf, I could hold no longer; and ſeeing none appeared to <hi>convince</hi> them of falſhood, I thought it my duty to do it my ſelf, leſt they ſhould think <hi>that they are the people,</hi> v. 13. — 12.2. and leſt error ſhould triumph over Chriſtian light and truth. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as a Novice I might have been afraid <hi>to proffer my opinion,</hi> v. 6. againſt ſo many grave, learned and Right Reverend Fathers in God, (ſo called) had I not, as well as <hi>Elihu,</hi> v. 9. (after having thought, like him, that <hi>Days ſhould ſpeak, and the old ſtanding Profeſſors ſhould teach wiſdom,</hi> v. 7.) found that the famous Doctors are not <hi>always the wiſeſt,</hi> and that theſe Aged Fathers are not they that <hi>underſtand the Art of diſcerning best:</hi> For note, <hi>It was but a little that I had paſſed from the Watchmen of the City,</hi> ſaith the Soul in the Canticle 3.4. <hi>but I found my wiſhes:</hi> That is, ſo ſoon as we paſs from the Watchmen, or leave them, and not whilſt we ſpend the time in conſulting and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to learn of them, as <hi>v.</hi> 3. our Soul comes to attain to that which it longs after, its own <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> the knowledge of God and Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. for it is the gift of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40429:11"/>God, the Watchmen cannot give it, ſince they ſeldom <hi>enter in themſelves, and keep from others the key of</hi> truth <hi>and knowledge,</hi> Luk. 11.52. But on the contrary, <hi>that they may,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Gal. 4.17. <hi>though they exclude others, be by them affected,</hi> cryed up, followed after, endeavour (as for inſtance, this Preacher) to ſuppreſs it. Whence they that relie on them, that ſeek for truth at their mouth, that dig for it in their works, <hi>(Nemo dat quod non habet)</hi> find nothing but <hi>vain knowledge,</hi> and that <hi>their bellies are fed,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>with the Eaſt wind.</hi> But beſides, having alſo found out, like <hi>Elihu,</hi> v. 8. that <hi>there is a Spirit in man, and that the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almighty is that which gives him underſtanding,</hi> without reſpect to his Age, or to his Humane Learning; and believing that the <hi>mouth and wiſdom</hi> promiſed <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. <hi>which all the Adverſaries are not able to reſist,</hi> is given in time of need, why ſhould I be afraid to give my teſtimony, and to ſtand againſt them all for the truth of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Therefore though <hi>I am neither a Prophet nor Prophet's Son,</hi> Amos 7.14. (not ſo much as a Graduate in the Schools and High places
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40429:12"/>of your Watchmen and Prophets) but a poor obſcure Tradeſman, who am not ſo much as known among any Chriſtian Sects, and am tyed, and ſupported, to none, and by none of them; <hi>though briars and thorns be with me, and I dwell among Scorpions,</hi> Ezek. 2.6. yet, worthy Maſter Vicar, I am ſo far from being <hi>diſmay'd at your,</hi> and your Biſhop's ſupercilious <hi>looks,</hi> that I will make bold here, with the help of God's Spirit, not only to anſwer you in very different terms from thoſe, who, <hi>ſeeking for praiſe</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe from other men, endeavour to pleaſe all men, and take care to diſpleaſe none; but <hi>to try</hi> both <hi>your Spirit,</hi> and of your Lords Spiritual, (who by their approbation of your Doctrine of Spirits, give me cauſe enough to think that they are of the ſame mind) and <hi>to judge and to pronounce</hi> (call it never ſo much <hi>pragmatical cenſuring, reviling of dignities, and rebelling against them</hi>) that the reaſon and the cauſe why you diſcourſe ſo ſtrangely concerning the Spirit of God, is becauſe you are very great ſtrangers to it; and meer <hi>natural men</hi> ſtill, who being not able therefore to <hi>diſcern the things of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. are much leſs able to teach
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40429:12"/>others what belongs to them. Let your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be never ſo well improved at your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of Learning, and be you never ſo much <hi>guided by the clue of it,</hi> (they are your words, pag. 15.) yet, <hi>except you be born again of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> you are without God's Kingdom, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the myſteries thereof are nothing to you but meer <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.11. and you can be nothing but <hi>blind leaders of the blind</hi> people that hear you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a Spirit in man:</hi> And without being Quaker, Enthuſiaſt or Fanatick, (and ſuppoſe I were one, muſt men reject truth, becauſe they or the Quakers teach it?) I ſay, that God's Spirit, which inſpires man with all knowledge and underſtanding, is given to all Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>to guide them into all truth;</hi> ſo that fearching by the Light of this Spirit, even <hi>the deep and hidden things of God,</hi> ch. 2. 10.

               <p>Neither do any of the Chriſtian Sects, I know of, deny the ſaid allowance of the Spirit to themſelves, though ſome exclude other men, ſuch as the Jews and Heathen: And Maſter Vicar himſelf is ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying and arguing againſt it, that he makes it his buſineſs by a new diſtinction of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ordinary Spirit, to ſhew that though the former is ceaſed, as he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, yet the Chriſtian Church always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40429:15"/>and hath the latter of the two conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. His words are theſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. viz. <hi>The Apostles extraordinary Spirit continued more or leſs about</hi> 400 <hi>years in God's Church, and men wrought Miracles, and thereby convinced Gainſayers, though about that time they were not ſo numerous and plentiful as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the reaſon was, becauſe there was no ſuch need of them, and a little after they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: For when the occaſion and reaſon of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles ceaſed, as Kings proving Nurſing-Fathers to the Church, the Goſpel being a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion in most Countries, then God in his wiſdom ſuſpended that great and mighty power wherewith he had accompanied good men before: Therefore men are now to look for no other Spirit but what is neceſſary for their needs, as they are Christians.</hi> Having ſaid, pag. 4. that the Primitive Chriſtians ſtood in need as Apoſtles of their extraordinary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, upon the account of both the Jews and Gentiles, <hi>there being great reaſon that ſuch as were the immediate Instruments of ſo great an undertaking as making void a Law, to wit, the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>which had been ſettled by God, and convincing the prejudiced Gentiles of the truth of their perſons, as well as of their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40429:15"/>doctrine, ſhould have a proportionable commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſtrength to do it with. Alas!</hi> (adds he, pag. 5.) <hi>had it not been for this, the Goſpel would have been nipp'd in its firſt budding forth; and it would have been a downright im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility for ſo great a part of the World to have been impoſed upon, by ſuch a company of illiterate perſons, as the Apoſtles, before the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, were. Can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that ſuch learned men as</hi> Dionyſius, <hi>and other perſons brought up in the Schools at</hi> Athens, <hi>who well underſtood the principles and connexion of things, would have ſubmitted to the pretences of ſuch bold and rude perſons, who could ſhew no reaſon at all, beyond their own conſident aſſertions, for what they ſaid? No, it was impoſſible; and by the way this one thing ſhews the great neceſſity of humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and is a ſufficient confutation of all thoſe Enthuſiasts who do revile it; to wit, that what the Apoſtles wanted of it upon the ſcore of Education, God ſupplied by Miracle. But for their extraordinary Spirit, it is a plain caſe, becauſe we daily experience it, that it is ceaſed, and that no man can now pretend to it; for he that pretends to the ſame Spirit the Apoſtles had, muſt do the ſame things, or elſe he is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40429:16"/>mighty vain, and argues his underſtanding to be much impaired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now judge ye who is more vain than this Vicar, who denies Scripture, and the experience of ſeveral ſober, learned, pious, godly men, who have been Eye-witneſſes, and teſtifie and relate the Miracles wrought upon ſome faithful believing men, ſince his four hundred years, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. Judge alſo whether his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can teach him, that the ſaid Spirit is ceaſed: For the gift of Miracles being but one of many belonging to that Spirit, and all the gifts being not given to every one of thoſe that truly believe, but one or two gifts to each, as in page — appears; he muſt needs be acquainted with all the true Believers that live all the World over, to ſay that his Experience, and that of his acquaintance, (who are as well informed as himſelf, of what paſſeth daily among the faithful) ſhews him that none of them can at preſent pretend to it: when the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> (who was as noted a man, I hope, as the Vicar) knew not one of the ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand faithful men who lived in his time in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.14, 18. and they that can
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40429:16"/>do theſe things, do not ſeek <hi>to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to be known openly,</hi> John 5.44. — 7.4, 6. Luk. 8.56. But though they did, and wrought ſome Miracles every day in the ſight of all the World, yet they that ſay that Miracles are ceaſed ſo long ago, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them no ſooner than their fellow Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, who though blaſphemous enough to aſcribe the glory of them to <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> were not ſo ſilly as to pretend that they were ceaſed.</p>
               <p>Then, obſerve from his own words, that what God <hi>by Miracle ſupplied of</hi> Humane Learning, <hi>being wanted upon the ſcore of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> might by Education have been got without Miracle: and ſo what need was there God ſhould ſupply by Miracle, what he might have had and done plentifully without it? For there lived at the time that Chriſt choſe the Apoſtles, many other men, who had by their Education got Humane Learning enough to hold out an Argument againſt the learned Heathen. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had enough, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.3. needed not, I preſume, (to ſupply his want of it) receive the ſame fulneſs of Spirit as the other twelve: yet he received it, and that with as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40429:17"/>circumſtance as all the reſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17, 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. — 12.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6, 8. Beſides, the neceſſity of Humane Learning (Logick, Metaphyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to convince <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and other learned Gentiles, whoſe conviction the Vicar ſaid before was the hard task that required ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spirit, implys that Humane Learning was the means the Apoſtles made uſe of to convince them, contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6, 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. And if ſo, may not they that are now great Maſters in it, (although by Education) and ſay they make uſe of it, (as the Divines of theſe times againſt their Adverſaries) pretend to do the ſame things, and to have therefore the ſame Spirit the Apoſtles had? <hi>Verhum ſat ſapienti;</hi> this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but by the way to give the ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a hint of what the Learning of thoſe wiſe men will produce, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19, 20. And they have ill luck, who whilſt they <hi>ſeek for honour and praiſe</hi> for their Learning and Wiſdom, not only get no credit, but forfeit, by what they were in great hopes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome, that which they were look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have already gotten.</p>
               <p>But O that they were as wiſe and learned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40429:17"/>as they pretend, and as they would ſeem to be! for then they might do ſome good, and had ſaved me the trouble of declaring now for them; that the Apoſtles Spirit continues ſtill in the Church, that all men have the ſame right, and as good pretences to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Spirit the Apoſtles had, as the Apoſtles themſelves; and that they may now have it, and, if they will make uſe of the ſame means they uſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. — 2.1. — 15.7, 8. <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. receive it, and be filled with it, as much as they were.

And ſo, from theſe words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> that it appears
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40429:18"/>that the Apoſtles Spirit, or the ſame Spirit they had, never ceaſeth in the Church, nor in any National Religion, Sect, or party, until it ceaſeth to be the Church and the Flock of Chriſt: for then, not only the gift of Miracles, (to which, and to their skill in Humane Learning got without Education, he ſeems chiefly to confine the Apoſtolical gift) but all other gifts alſo, which do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly wait upon that of the Spirit, (ſuch as wiſdom and knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8.) are removed and <hi>taken away</hi> from that Sect, in God's wrath, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.5. (rather than wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as the wiſe Vicar, meaſuring it by his own ſhallow brains and dull fancy, as ſhall be ſhewed in its place, ſaith God <hi>did ſuſpend</hi> the ſame) that Church becomes <hi>deſolate,</hi> and remains according to the Prophecy of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> 9.27. and the conſtruction thereof by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 24.15. and St. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.20. <hi>compaſſed</hi> (inſtead of Chriſt's preſence by the Holy Ghoſt) with <hi>abominable armies</hi> and companies of Church-men.</p>
               <p>Only, as <hi>there are divers adminiſtrations and gifts</hi> of the ſame Divine Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12.4, 6. ſuch as <hi>wiſdom and knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, tongues, prophecy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40429:19"/>of Spirits;</hi> which are not all to be found in one member, or <hi>Paul</hi> is much miſtaken, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 29, 30. ſo, I muſt here further declare for Maſter Vicar, and all his fellow Watchmen, that though one man doth not do all the ſame operations that all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did, yet if he doth ſome of them, he may pretend to the ſame Spirit the Apoſtles had: for <hi>if the ear ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it not of it therefore?</hi> v. 16. that is, if he that hath but the diſcerning of Spirits, ſhould ſay becauſe I am not a Teacher or a Prophet, I have none of the ſame extraordinary Spirit as the Prophets have, hath he not therefore been made <hi>to drink of the ſame Spirit?</hi> v. 13. for if the <hi>whole</hi> ſpiritual <hi>body were prophecy, where were the gift</hi> of knowledge and diſcerning of Spirits? v. 17. and if they were all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or all workers of Miracles, where were the ſeveral members, and operations that conſtitute or make up the ſaid ſpiritual body? v. 19. Thus, do I from St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak here for Maſter Vicar; and will yet further inſtance St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (a chief Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6, 7.) during the time of whoſe preaching and ſtay at <hi>Antioch,</hi> arrived certain Prophets,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40429:19"/>one of which did <hi>propheſie that there ſhould be a great dearth or famine throughout the World,</hi> Act. 11.26, 27, 28. to whom the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who were doubtleſs directed by <hi>Paul</hi> and by <hi>Barnabas,</hi> gave credit; and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, though he had a greater gift of the Spirit, did not ſay or object that he wondred that his inferiour ſhould have this thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, when he knew nothing of it. And elſewhere that ſame Prophet foretold <hi>Paul,</hi> what <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf foreſaw not in his own caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.10. (or he had (what he did not) foreſeen that he had been ſet at liberty, if he had not appealed to <hi>Caeſar, Act.</hi> 25.26. — 26.31, 32.) to wit, that he ſhould be taken at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and, <hi>thus ſaith the Holy Ghost,</hi> ſaid then that certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, (for ſo the Scripture calls him) <hi>ch.</hi> 21.11. Whence I ask the Vicar, ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> could pretend to as good a ſhare at leaſt of the ſame holy Spirit, as that certain Prophet did, why did not the Holy Ghoſt reveal the ſame things to him? Becauſe, though he had knowledge, and underſtood myſteries, as he was an Apoſtle, yet he was not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; for, <hi>are all Prophets,</hi> ſaith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29, 30. <hi>are all workers of Miracles?</hi> as all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40429:20"/>are not Apoſtles, <hi>v.</hi> 28. ſo I cannot work all the ſaid other gifts in me: it being God alone that <hi>doth work them all</hi> (and note) <hi>in all,</hi> and not in one man, <hi>v.</hi> 6. Likewiſe I ask, if he that hath the gift to diſcern the Spirit of the Vicar, and ſome portion of knowledge, hath not the gift of Miracles, hath he not therefore the ſame Spirit as the Apoſtles? But what ſay you, Vicar, to what <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf doth ſtile <hi>yet a more excellent way</hi> than Miracles and Prophecy, and <hi>the beſt of the ſaid gifts,</hi> viz. Charity? <hi>v.</hi> 31. — 13.2. is that ceaſed in your Church? I dare ſay you are not willing to acknowledge it: and ſo like the Chief Prieſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.25, 26. you are hedg'd in on both ſides: for if you ſay that this more extraordinary gift is not ceaſed in the Church, neither, by your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, are the other gifts alſo, which are counted by St. <hi>Paul</hi> not ſo excellent as this, ceaſed, as you teach, from it: and if you ſay that it is ceaſed there, then judge whether you are ſtill a faithful Church: for do they believe in Chriſt that omit one of the firſt and chiefeſt of his precepts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.39. <hi>John</hi> 13.34. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.11. and take quite another way than that which he hath ſhewed them?</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40429:20"/>
               <p>And this laſt, your Argument, that he muſt do the ſame things who pretends to the ſame Spirit the Apoſtles had, proves further, or you muſt yield that it is of no force and validity at all, (which <hi>dilemma,</hi> as likewiſe the other, your great Learning could not foreſee, and prevent your being now put to them) for the Apoſtles were ſent to do, what? Signs and Miracles? No ſure; but to preach, and win or gain Souls, by teaching them the way to their converſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. This they did in all places, but preached in many places, nay they convinced many, and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> himſelf, and eſtabliſhed Churches, without working of Miracles, as may be ſeen by their Acts: and their Miracles were not always wrought to convince the gainſayers of the Faith, (which you ſay was <hi>the reaſon and the occaſion of them</hi>) ſince they wrought them ſometimes in their private Meetings by night, amongſt the faithful, as for inſtance, at <hi>Troas, Act.</hi> 20.7, 8, 9, 10. Now you will grant that it is incumbent upon the Church to preach, exhort and win Souls, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. and you pretend you do it: ſo that if you do it not, you are not a faithful Church, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40429:21"/>burthenſom hypocrites, <hi>&amp; inutilia hujus pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera terrae;</hi> and if you do it, you do the works of the Apoſtles; therefore, by your Argument, have the ſame Spirit they had, and ſo it is not ceaſed; but it is your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ceaſeth to be in force, if that can be ſaid to ceaſe, which had never any true exiſtence, but in a falſe and erroneous fancy. <hi>He that winneth Souls is wiſe,</hi> Prov. 11.30. Dan. 12.3. wiſdom is by <hi>Paul,</hi> counted the firſt gift of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 31. If therefore you win ſome Souls, (as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that ſome of your number do, or elſe what reaſon is there why you ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon a Chriſtian Nation as neceſſary to them?) have you not a greater gift of the Spirit than Miracles, which are, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Paul,</hi> v. 29. but the fourth in order? and do you not do a greater thing than Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and ſo as great a thing as any of the Apoſtles? <hi>He that hath as much faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> may do all wonders, Mat. 17.20. and yet, witneſs <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.2. <hi>he is nothing.</hi> And there is a greater need of the beſt gift, Charity, and a greater ſtrength of Faith requiſite to do like <hi>Paul,</hi> (that he might help to ſave ſome) <hi>to become

               <p>From whence obſerve, that the end and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40429:32"/>occaſion of Miracles, is not the conviction of the gainſayers of the Faith, (as our worthy Vicar not only takes for granted, but urgeth the ſcarceneſs of gainſayers, by the Goſpel becoming a National Religion in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, for an argument of the ceſſation of all Miracles) ſeeing they are wrought, firſt, to confirm the believing of the Word, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and encourage believers to continue in the Faith, when they have once received it: and ſecondly, to puniſh the ſcorners and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers; them that ſeek to <hi>turn away</hi> thoſe that are prepared for Salvation, <hi>from the Faith;</hi> them that blaſpheme the Name of God, and that contribute to the diſhonour of it, as from <hi>Elymas,</hi> Act. 13.8, 10. the two Captains of fifty, 2 Kings 1.10, 12. <hi>Gehazi,</hi> ch. 5.22. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> may be learned.

And indeed it were better for falſe teachers to be hang'd, or <hi>caſt into the Sea with a ſtone tyed to their neck,</hi> Luk. 17.1. than they ſhould give ſuch offence, as that the Vicar's Sermon hath given to many men: for when at the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day one ſhall accuſe the other, that he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40429:33"/>hath cauſed him to erre, and curſe him for the evil doings he hath committed, this ſhall then excuſe himſelf upon his next Superiour, and the Superiour upon the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Supreme Power upon his falſe Counſellors; who, having no other plea, ſhall caſt the fault of all theſe upon their wicked Teachers, who have kept them in darkneſs; and inſtead of reproving their courſes, to bring them to a righteous and godly life, have for ſome <hi>Preferments ſake</hi> ſoothed them up in their ſins; then <hi>ſhall the bloud of all theſe be required at their hands,</hi> Ezek. 33.6.

And in further evidence that ſigns are not to convince the gainſayers of the Faith, we do not find any where in Scripture, that any man who was not before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand prepared and enclined, (like the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul <hi>Sergius,</hi> Act. 13.7.) was convinced thereupon: for, as for them which <hi>John</hi> ſaith 2.23. <hi>believed in the name of Chriſt, ſeeing the miracle which he had done in</hi> Cana, it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40429:33"/>appears from what he ſaith in the following verſes, 24,25. of Chriſt not thinking it fit <hi>to commit himſelf to them, knowing what</hi> faith <hi>was in them;</hi> that their faith was ſuch as that of <hi>Simon,</hi> who <hi>believed and wondred</hi> (Act. 13.41.) <hi>beholding the mirarles which were done,</hi> ch. 8.13. but believed not like them, <hi>v.</hi> 12. who it is ſaid believed at the preaching of <hi>Philip,</hi> v. 17. for his heart was, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> v. 21, 23. <hi>not right in the ſight of God,</hi> and he was ſtill in the dark, auſtere and anxious ſource, or <hi>the gall of bitterneſs;</hi> far from a true faith in Chriſt, that brings man off of that ſtate.

               <p>And certainly if Miracles were (as the Vicar ſaith) the reaſon of conviction, and if <hi>there was great reaſon that ſuch as were the inſtruments of ſo great an undertaking</hi> in the firſt Age of the Church, <hi>before the Goſpel was a National Religion,</hi> and whilſt many gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers were yet to be convinced, <hi>ſhould have

And if not only thoſe falſe Prophets who work their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by the help of the Devil, but the Nigro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer alſo, who acts by the ſtrength alone of humane nature, can effect wonderful things; as by retiring but for one moment within himſelf, and ſetting very ſtrongly his will upon a thing, though at a great diſtance from him, introduce and bring to paſs his deſire upon it, or at leaſt ſtamp upon it ſuch mark or impreſſion, as the longing Mother doth upon the fruit in her womb; as appears plain by <hi>Balaam</hi> curſing or bewitching by Enchantments whom he would, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.6. — 24.1. except God by a ſpecial providence prevented him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.10. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.23. why ſhould the ſame power be denied to faithful men, though they live among the <hi>Turks,</hi> or are reputed <hi>Papiſts?</hi> eſpecially being more Maſters of their own Paſſions, than ſuch natural men as a Nigromancer is; and their minds more abſtracted from all lower things, becauſe <hi>their converſation is in the heaven above.</hi> But to do all parties right, it muſt needs be confeſſed that ſome of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Saints, as <hi>Bruno, Lopez,</hi> and ſuch, have by their <hi>fruits</hi> or their works, as by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40429:38"/>denying themſelves, and dying to all the World, and to all the comfort they did enjoy of this life, to follow ever after their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our under the croſs; <hi>wandring in deſarts, mountains, and dens,</hi> Heb. 11.38. without <hi>taking thought</hi> how they ſhould ſubſiſt and live; ſhewed us that they did truly and really believe in Chriſt: and ſo we have no reaſon to think but <hi>that he met them,</hi> Iſa. 64.5.

               <p>That the other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> parties have alſo ſeen ſome of the ſame wonders and ſigns done by the power of Faith, upon ſome among themſelves, it is no hard thing to give ſeveral inſtances of, and even out of ſome of their own Martyrologies: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that read them may obſerve the ſame themſelves, and to avoid, as much as I can prolixity, out of many inſtances which are come to my knowledge in many parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> I will give only two, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur and have been ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> not ſo long time ago but that ſeveral ſufficient eye witneſſes of the one are ſtill living, and ready to atteſt it; as the other is likewiſe by the teſtimony of great many judicious and learned ſpectators of the ſame, now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.</p>
               <p>The firſt inſtance is of a blind man that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40429:43"/>received his ſight; who being a Labourer, by name <hi>Robert Lancaster,</hi> of <hi>Caſtleacre</hi> a Town in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> had loſt one eye by a Thorne, and the other by a Stubble in binding ſheaves in Harveſt. He was at leaſt five years without the leaſt ſight, and all that time earned his living with bunching of Flax and Hemp, being led by his Son, or an Apprentice he had, from one Town to another. He was a conſtant hearer of the Word; and one Sunday about 30 years ago, being at Church, where hearing that part of the Goſpel read or expounded, which we find in the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> v. 6, 7. <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt ſpat on the ground, made clay, and ſpread it upon the eyes of the man born blind, and ſent him to waſh his eyes in the Pool of</hi> Siloam, <hi>which done, he came</hi> thence <hi>ſeeing:</hi> God, it ſeems, who <hi>opens mens ears</hi> in adverſity, <hi>by dreams, viſions of the night, or by an interpreter, and one among a thouſand, to ſhew man his uprightneſs,</hi> that is, the way which he may become righteous and juſt by, Job 33.15, 16, 23. <hi>opened his heart to attend to the things that were ſpoken,</hi> Act. 16.14. and to believe that God being as able and ready as ever to help all thoſe who, truſting
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40429:44"/>to his goodneſs, call earneſtly upon him, the ſame thing might then be done by him as well as before; and in this confidence, as ſoon as he came from Church, he cauſed his Wife to get ſome clay from the wall of his Cottage, and tempering it with his own ſpittle, anointed his eyes, and then deſired to be led to a Spring which is in a place not far from thence, called <hi>Broad Meadow,</hi> where waſhing his eyes, he did preſently receive ſome ſight; and waſhing a ſecond time, he had a very good ſight for all his life afterwards, which was about eight years; and uſed for a great part of that time Threſhing, in his, and other Towns round about. All this is certainly affirmed by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral yet living in the ſame Town, who knew <hi>Lancaſter</hi> before and ſince his recovery; by the Son of him that was then Miniſter of that Town, who lives now in <hi>Snedſham</hi> not far from <hi>Caſtleacre,</hi> his name is <hi>William Turner;</hi> by <hi>Philip Pagraff</hi> of <hi>Little Appleton,</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> likewiſe; <hi>Thomas Boot,</hi> a Silk-weaver, who dwells now in <hi>Goat-Alley,</hi> by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery-Ground;</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mary Gold,</hi> dwelling in the <hi>Haberdaſhers-Hall;</hi> and by <hi>Lancaster</hi>'s own Son, (who lives within five miles of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40429:44"/>the ſaid <hi>Caſtleacre</hi>) and Daughter, who is married within three miles of <hi>London.</hi> And this Relation comes from the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the ſaid <hi>Caſtleacre,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Briggs,</hi> who though a ſound Epiſcopal man, hath ſent it in writing to one of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>The other inſtance is of one <hi>Briggs,</hi> a North-Country man, of a competent Eſtate; which is obſervable, (1.) for his falling into Trances; (2.) for his great Faith, whereby he overcame the Tempter, and caſt him out, or at leaſt, far from himſelf, when in the fiery tryal (which goes uſually before an unfeigned converſion) he did (as he never fails to do on ſuch occaſion) aſſault him with all the might and the wiles he hath at hand, to make the deſpairing Soul fall under his temptation; (3.) for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſtrangeneſs of his diſeaſe; and (4.) for his cure and recovery, without the help of all other means, than of a ſtrong Faith in Chriſt. This ſame <hi>Briggs</hi> was a Lawyer of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> a godly man, about 30 years of age, and contemporary to <hi>Fox</hi> the Author of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Martyrology: His caſe, and all that paſſed between the Tempter and him all the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40429:45"/>time of his Trances, is in truth ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that, as it induced then, many pious learned men, both Phyſicians and Divines, (who reſorted to his Houſe all that while every day, to hear the things which he ſpake) to put it in writing; ſo it induceth me to give it at large, as they have left it, to the publick; that they may ſee in ſeeing, and believe the extraordinary working of the Holy Ghoſt in good men, to convert them, as well now as heretofore: and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring my ſelf for the particulars thereof to their Memorial, that ſhall be, God willing, printed within a ſhort time; I will give over here the diſcourſe of the power of Faith, and of the faithful working Miracles to this day, to follow the main deſign of this, the demonſtration of the Apoſtles Spirit conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in Chriſt's Church as long as the World endures.</p>
               <p>To which end, the diſtinction of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and ordinary Spirit, ſet up by Maſter Vicar, is to be conſidered of; and we are to underſtand that, though the Apoſtles had the extraordinary Spirit he aſcribes to them, whereby they wrought Miracles; yet it is properly ſuch (that is, extraordinary)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40429:45"/>in reſpect only of the Spirit of Lip-Chriſtian-Biſhops, and natural men; for the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary circumſtances it came and ſate with on the Apoſtles, doth not make it to be the more extraordinary: neither did it preſently (though it introduced them into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Light, and opened unto them the principle and the center of all wiſdom and knowledge; whence the language of nature, and the wonderful works of God, were at the ſame time underſtood and ſeen of them) ſhew and reveal unto them what they ſhould believe and teach in any doubtful caſes, for the time they were to live; but <hi>reſpective</hi> to that of true Chriſtian believers, it is but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: for ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> again, Act. 15.9. <hi>the Lord put no difference between us and them,</hi> (meaning thoſe he had ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 7. believed) <hi>but he that knoweth the hearts</hi> (and therefore when men believe) <hi>bears them witneſs of their faith, by giving the Holy Ghoſt to them even as to us,</hi> v. 7, 8. Whence follows, that (ſince God bears witneſs to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, by giving the Holy Ghoſt to them, even as he did to the greateſt Apoſtles) all the faithful <hi>are ſealed,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. — 4.30. <hi>with the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40429:46"/>when they believe; and with an equal portion, when they believe equally. Thus, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whether Apoſtles, Teachers, or any men, provided they be believers indeed, being all made to partake, or <hi>drink of one</hi> and the ſame extraordinary <hi>Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. which is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, Act. 11.17. by <hi>Peter</hi> pleading that God <hi>gave</hi> the Gentiles <hi>the like gift as he had done unto him:</hi> what he durſt not have pleaded, if there had been between the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and the converted Gentiles Spirit ſuch difference as the Biſhops imagine: for had there been any ſuch difference in their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they that contended with him, as grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining that the Gentiles ſhould enjoy the ſame priviledge they did, had given him ſome anſwer, (which we do not read they did) and not glorified God for it, as we read they did, <hi>v.</hi> 18. But truly this diſtinction of an ordinary and extraordinary Spirit among believers, being yet unknown with them, they freely acquieſced: and it being neither found nor grounded upon Scripture, which, on the contrary, aſſerteth the unity and the identity of Spirit, and ſpeaks no where but of one and the ſame
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40429:46"/>Spirit all the Church over: we are rather to adhere, like them, to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this difference, than to the newer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Epiſcopal Church, which, to the withſtanding of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.17. ſtands ſtoutly for it.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40429:48"/>Idolatry in</hi> Athens: that is, he had not a mean and ordinary impulſe and paroxyſme upon him.

Truly no; he diſputed daily in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and in the Market, out of that which he knew already; and by reaſons which his light and knowledge ſuggeſted him were like to work upon them, he ſhewed them their ignorance of God, which raiſed in ſome a mind to know him better. And the ſum of the reaſons he orged to them was, that the God whom they did worſhip out of their exceſs of zeal, without knowing him, was he that made the whole World, and could not <hi>per</hi> conſequent be confined to their Temples; that he having made alſo all things in Heaven and Earth, and giving to all creatures life and breath, we have from him, and in him our being, and ſo are all his off-ſpring, as they had even been taught by ſome of their learned men, <hi>viz.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40429:55"/>Lords with all their great wiſdom that <hi>comes to nought,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.6.

               <p>And here, had I but time enough, I could run down the Biſhops ſo very low, that they would be glad to make of their Sleeves a <hi>Moſes</hi> vail, if they knew what they know not, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.5. and were not ſo <hi>confident, Prov.</hi> 14.16.

And St. <hi>Paul</hi> is perſwaded that the believing <hi>Romans were filled with all knowledge,</hi> without going to <hi>Athens,</hi> Rom. 15.14. Where is therefore any room left here for the School-learning? and how mainly are the poor Enthuſiaſts confuted from a concatenation of ſilly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and refuted by Scripture? as firſt, that the Learned men among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were convinced by the means and help of Humane Learning; ſecondly, that it was given to the Apoſtles by a pretended Miracle; and thirdly, that there is therefore a great need of it: but what to do, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould do very well to tell; for now that <hi>the Goſpel is a National Religion, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40429:57"/>Kings prove Nurſing-fathers to them</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, what greater occaſion have they of this effect of the extraordinary Spirit of the Apoſtles, than of that which they ſay is ceaſed ſo many years ſince? and it is very probable, though they will not burn their Books upon the ſame account as the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.18, 19. that upon the ſame account as the fat <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, they will lay them all aſide; and, as ſoon as they perceive with how little inconvenience they may ſave themſelves the trouble of reading and of ſtudying, ſuffer all Humane Learning to ceaſe among them likewiſe, if they have not already made a good ſtep towards it: for to be well verſed in the Hiſtory of what the Scripture ſaith and teacheth, is part of Humane Learning, and of their own profeſſion; of which part or Hiſtory it appears manifeſtly from what is ſaid hitherto, that they are ill informed; or very full of malice, if whilſt they know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, they not only conceal them, but teach falſhood in their ſtead.</p>
               <p>And ſince that, contrary to the practice of true Chriſtians, who burned their learned Books, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.19. they preach ſo much for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40429:57"/>Learning, what Learning have they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and what great knowledge have they thereby attained unto, above illiterate men? I am ſure I have not met in any of their Works, with any new thing found out by them worth the writing: nor (becauſe I am not well verſed in their Writings, as peruſing very few of them, and very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) have I met one among many of their admirers, whom I have ſtrictly enquired from, if they could indicate in all their Works any of their inventions and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries uſeful to mankind, and worth their while, and the charges they were at for tranſlating and printing, who could, though they know well what their Books contain, ſhew me one. But I have met in thoſe few I have peruſed, ſeveral particular inſtances of their weakneſs; and in general, nothing but what (if well confronted with the Books of the Ancient) doth betray their ignorance of what the wiſe Ancient knew, and the petulant itching they have to ſhew their non-ſenſe, in writing abſurdly of things, though they were before truly and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by the Ancient.</p>

And though they have not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>ex proſeſſo</hi> in one place of the <hi>Fuga vacui,</hi> and of its limited ſtrength, yet it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd by piece-meal out of their Books, that they were not ignorant of Fluids riſing to their uſual height, and no higher; nor of their reſpective Columns falling and riſing afterwards by heat and cold: and that they underſtood well that theſe their ſolution of heavy Fluids riſing into ſpaces void of Air, to wit, <hi>Fuga vacui,</hi> implys ſo much and no leſs. For they were men of good ſence, and good ſence ſhews that <hi>Fuga vacui</hi> ſignifies firſt, the end for which Fluids riſe, to wit, a prevention of a <hi>vacuum</hi> by them: ſecondly, a prevention as far as the ſaid Fluids are
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40429:61"/>permitted to aſcend; which they knew to be no more than the weight of that Fluid Body, in whoſe ſtead they come to ſupply the ſpace left and derelicted by it, amounts to; that is, as much as a <hi>cylinder</hi> of Air, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate unto that of the ſucceeding Fluid, would weigh were it condenſed into as cloſe a texture, as the ſaid ſucceeding Fluid Body conſiſts of; but weights not, becauſe it is an uncondenſed vapour: and laſtly, a further riſing of the ſaid Columns after they have ſubſided, unto their uſual ſtation, to wit, when the Air which is in the void ſpace above them, (though it be pumped out ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo long, and as clean as frequent immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and filling the Pipe again after the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding of the Column, can do it) becomes by cold weather more condenſed than it was when the Pipe was immerſed; and thereby ceaſeth to fill that ſpace ſo much as it did, and to keep the <hi>cylinder</hi> from riſing to ſuch height, as the proportion of weight which it is not to exceed doth allow of and permit. And, as for the falling again of the ſame Column, it being but a ceaſing of the cauſe it did riſe by, that is, of the condenſing and contraction of the Air; and an eaſie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40429:62"/>conſequence of the <hi>Fuga vacui,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>vacuum</hi> prevented by another Body than that of the <hi>cylinder,</hi> that is, by that of the Air, extending it ſelf further in warm, than in cold weather, and ſo taking up again that part of the ſpace it had, by its condenſation, yielded up to the Column) they could not but underſtand it well, though without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making tryal of it: and underſtand well alſo from hence, that ſince the Column riſeth up and falls again by the Airs alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive contraction and extenſion, (as by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſſively to the ſpace which is above the Column, a Candle lighted, and a wet Spunge or a piece of Ice, this making the Column to riſe, and that to ſubſide, it will preſently appear) this <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> ſerves but to ſhew hot and cold weather: and is no ſuch improvement therefore as our Sages would make of it, if they could, that is, a new Inſtrument to foretell all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſtitutions of the Air, and changes of the weather; but a bare <hi>Thermometer,</hi> an old trivial invention, which our great Improvers have at laſt with much ado <hi>happily lighted upon,</hi> in this our learned Age.</p>
               <p>And that they cannot make ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40429:62"/>that is, a true Weather-glaſs of it, appears firſt, from that they have beſtowed much time and labour upon it theſe twenty years, with no better ſucceſs, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out improving or making their invention fitter for uſe, than it was when they firſt went about it: and next, from the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which flows neceſſarily from their own Hypotheſis, and the uſe they make of it to ſolve the <hi>Phoenomenon;</hi> by which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it is againſt both reaſon and ſence) they can never give a true and diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> nor therefore bring it thereby into the uſe they pretend it ſerves for. For firſt, (to begin by what flows from their Hypotheſis) they gather (and it follows) from thence, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. that when the Air is lighteſt, the Column ſubſides loweſt; and when it is moſt heavy, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn riſeth higheſt: whereas daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth contrary to this, that in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled clear weather, the Air being then light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the Column riſeth higher, than in dull rainy weather, and ſinks to its loweſt ſtation in rainy weather, when the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt thick and full of vapours, which crouding and condenſing in it, ſhould make
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40429:63"/>it heavier, and preſs up the Column with greater force, and raiſe it therefore higher than it was, if the Airs counter preſſure were the cauſe of its riſing: In windy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo the Column is very low, and many times lower at that time than when it rains; whereas the Air, flowing then laterally, hath no ſuch preſſure upon the <hi>ſtagnum</hi> as it would in ſtill weather, if it had any at all. Which I prove by filling a Porridge-pot with Water, and holding and toſſing it by the handle, ſo that by its ſwinging forwards and backwards, both the Water may be ſet in motion, and its motion be determinated in <hi>latus;</hi> then fetching with the hand a whole turn, that is, deſcribing vertically with the Pot a circle or ring, whereby when the Pot is up at the Zenith of the circle, its mouth be turned downwards; for then none of the Water running down out of the Pot, this experiment alone will evidently evince that the Water loſing thus by its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>latus,</hi> its fall and preſſure down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; the Air would likewiſe abate (by the lateral motion it hath in windy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) of the deſcent and preſſure it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have. Secondly, though the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40429:63"/>doth not fall ſo low in the Winter, as in the Summer, nor riſeth ſo high in the Summer, as in the Winter, (for it never ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to one and thirty inches, but in cold froſty weather, becauſe then both the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the inward Air (which is in the void ſpace of the Pipe) is moſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed) yet they make no diſtinction of Seaſons in their <hi>Index:</hi> but in Winter and Summer they aſcribe the higheſt place (at one and thirty inches) to clear, ſettled, fair weather, and the lower to rainy, cloudy, and windy weather; when the Column marks between the ſame weather in the two foreſaid different Seaſons, (as ſettled fair in Winter, and ſettled fair in Summer) above an inch difference. A likely way to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and bring the <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> to ſerve for a Weatherglaſs! for the uſefulneſs of which happy invention of theirs, and for the truth of theſe few remarks and tryals of mine, I appeal to the ſingle-eyed and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgment of all thoſe who have the ſaid Inſtrument in their houſes: whilſt by another eaſie tryal, of no greater charge than of a ſealed glaſs Tube ſomewhat wider and longer than the ordinary one, I clear all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40429:64"/>ſcruples and controverſies; and ſhew more true things at once, than all the Experiments they have made theſe hundred years with a world of <hi>apparat,</hi> have taught them to diſcover.</p>
               <p>The Experiment is this: having filled a glaſs Tube or Pipe, cloſed at one end, of about ſix foot in length, with Water up to the brim; and therein immerſed another ſmaller empty glaſs Tube, eight inches long, nipt likewiſe, with its open end or orifice downwards; it (being thick of glaſs, and ſo, ſpecifically, that is to ſay, bulk for bulk, heavier than ſo much Water) ſunk to the bottom of the Water in the longer Pipe; yet not ſo ſwiftly, but that I could diſcern how faſt the Water got into it: And (whereas when it began to ſink, being then but juſt immerſed under water, ſcarce the ſixth part of one inch of water was ſeen in it) there was, by that time it had deſcended to the bottom, more than one inch of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (that came in at the lower open end) lodged in it, near its mouth or orifice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the greater depth and preſſure of the water upon it at the bottom, than when it began to ſink; which by compreſſing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40429:64"/>cloſer the Air that took up its whole cavity, or filled it full when it was firſt immerſed, made room for ſo much water as the ſaid inch to get in. Then, taking out the ſhort Pipe, and filling up, as before, the longer one with water, I immerſed again the ſame ſhort Pipe into it, but with the orifice or open end uppermoſt: and ſtopping at the ſame time the mouth of the longer one cloſe with the palm of my hand, I inverted both Pipes ſo nimbly, that before the ſhorter could deſcend at all, and the water fall in it, its mouth was turned downwards, and it was at the bottom of the Column of water, and ſo had all the ſame depth of the Column upon it, as it had before, when more than the ſaid inch of water was ſeen and lodged therein. And yet, though it had the ſame depth of water upon it, there was not the ſame preſſure at that time againſt the Air, (which it held when immerſed) as when the orifice of the long Pipe ſtood open: for all the while it was ſtopt, no more water got, or was received into this Pipe, than what had got into it, whilſt I inverted it, which was not above the ſixth or eighth part of an inch: becauſe the preſſure of the water
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40429:65"/>was, for want of Air to ſupply the place it had left void above at the top, if from thence it had moved downwards, ſuſpended and loſt. The ſame thing happened alſo, when the ſhorter Pipe, being made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thinner of glaſs, was light enough not to ſink, but to float in the water, and to riſe from the bottom thereof towards the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, when immerſed, as was ſaid, with the orifice upwards; and the long Pipe nimbly ſtopt and inverted thereupon: for it roſe, and in riſing the preſſure of the water, which ought to have been greater when the whole depth of the Column was upon the Pipe, than when but part of the ſame, by the Pipe riſing higher and higher, lay upon it, was no whit diminiſhed, as it was not encreaſed; or never the greater for this ſhorter Pipe being, when the longer one was overturned under all at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Which eaſie Experiment convincingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, Firſt, that the Column is not preſſed up and ſuſtained by any gravitation and counterpreſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> (as the Sages, in further token of their great wiſdom, teach and maintain) ſince that, when the Air is kept from coming at it, by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40429:65"/>the Pipe being ſealed above, and ſtopt very cloſe below, we ſee the preſſure of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuſpended and ſtopt: which could not be if the Air were the thing that doth bear up and hold to its equipoize the Column, by a counterforce equivalent to it. For here there was no Air left between my hand and the Pipe, whoſe Spring may be pretended (as in the Experiment deſcribed in the 35<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> page of the ſaid piece of <hi>Wallis</hi>) to bear it up: and though there were ſuch thing as the ſaid ſuppoſed Spring of the Sages in this caſe, yet it being ſaid but juſt equivalent to a whole Column of water, (whereof the whole preſſure is likewiſe ſuſpended, as may be tryed in a Tube 40 foot long) it could but juſt bear it up, (as did that part of my hand, which by inverting the Pipe, both the Pipe, and the Column within it, reſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and not make it move upwards, (as it muſt do to defeat the contrary motion, <hi>viz.</hi> the deſcent or preſſure downwards which the water hath; there being no other way but this one to prevent it, as we ſee done in this caſe;) for there is a greater force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to give to things heavy a motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, (as to ſling up a Stone for inſtance)

               <p>And laſtly, it demonſtrates the lightneſs or levity of the Air: ſeeing the Air included in the ſhort Pipe not only aſcends it ſelf, but riſeth with ſuch weight of the glaſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf, as would ſink without the Air, as being bulk for bulk heavier than ſo much water. And that this Air riſeth not by the heavier water <hi>thruſting and preſſing it up,</hi> (as the modern Sages ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 24.) out of the lowermoſt place, the following tryal evinceth manifeſtly; <hi>viz.</hi> when the Pipe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of <hi>Mercury</hi> or Water, and hanging down by a String, is left open to the Air, by removing the Finger the mouth of it is ſtopt with; for then the Air ruſheth in the Pipe with ſuch <hi>impetus,</hi> as throws upwards both the Pipe and the <hi>cylinder</hi> therein, and makes the Pipe to leap up one foot higher, more or leſs, than the place it reſted at before its orifice was opened, as I have ſaid, which would not be if the Air <hi>were preſſed up by heavier Fluids ſinking into it:</hi> for then it would only ſhift places, (as the water doth which you caſt Stones, or other ſinking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40429:70"/>into) and ſo juſt riſe and no more, and no higher than the place at which the Pipe reſted, and from which the <hi>cylinder</hi> therein did begin to ſink: whereas not only it ſhifts places, as the water doth, but thruſts upwards both the Pipe, and the <hi>cylinder</hi> therein; with the weight beſides which the incumbent Column of Air is ſaid to have upon it. And though the Air and other heavier vapours riſe ſometimes by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of other heavier Bodies into them, yet they riſe more frequently without it: for how could elſe thick clouds, ſmoak and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours riſe, that have nothing above them but the Air, which, as lighter, cannot preſs down into them; and that are beſides coarſer, thicker, and more condenſed when they begin to riſe, than when they are got higher: as by the rectifying of Ardent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits appears? And as for the experience which the Sages chiefly ground their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis upon in their 29. page, of Air com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed into a leſs room, which they have found on the ballance to have ſome ſmall weight and gravitation; it proving nothing but that Air compreſſed gravitates, and not that it gravitates in its own ordinary natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40429:71"/>conſtitution, it doth make nothing for them, and againſt its levity. For to ſerve their turn, it muſt gravitate ſuch as it is, without any compreſſion: becauſe by this compreſſion it being condenſed into a cloſer texture rhan it hath naturally, it acquires a degree of ſpecifick gravity; which, I am ſo far from denying in ſuch caſc, that I have ſaid it would be as heavy as water and other heavier Fluids, if it were by any means made as denſe and as compact, or reduced into as cloſe a texture or parts, or conſiſtence as they have. But as it is confeſſed that the Air ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome weight by condenſation, ſo on the other hand no ſober man will deny, that, ſince thoſe heavier Fluids, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirits, Oyl, and Water, and <hi>Mercury</hi> ſublimate it ſelf, loſe by their being turned into a vapour, though not ſo thin as the Air, their actual gravitation all the time they continue ſo near of kin to the Air, which is but a thin vapour, that is, all the time they are aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or ſubliming, and kept rarefied by heat; it (that is to ſay, the Air) doth, by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto its uſual conſtitution, loſe alſo that ſmall degree of acquired gravity, and hath none (ſenſible at leaſt) all the time it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40429:71"/>to be it ſelf, I mean an aërial, ſubtle, and uncondenſed vapour: as this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sages rather proves and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, than otherwiſe; for it appears plain by it, that the Air which had, after compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſome gravity, was found to have none before, though it was the ſame Air, and in the ſame quantity: and thereby they ſhew rather <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> another thing than they intended to prove, that is, that the <hi>cylinder</hi> in our <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> is not ſuſtained at all by the Airs counterpreſſure, ſeeing it hath none in its natural conſtitution; than that the Air in its ſaid natural conſtitution hath none of the levity which I aſcribe to it. And which the Doctor confutes by ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Maſter-piece of School-learning, which he apprehends to be ſo great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and cogent proofs againſt it, that I muſt beg the help of ſome Mathematician to remove them; and therefore,</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40429:72"/>gravity which I thought might exiſt before in his head only, being come down to his heels) can neither climb up the ſame, nor ſee for it what Figure hath the World which he lives in; and therefore thinks it is made like a Cone, or Pyramid: For (ſaith he, pag. 28.) <hi>if levity be the poſitive Principle of the Air riſing upwards, and if this motion upwards of the Air be natural, it muſt be either an averſeneſs from the Center, as the</hi> terminus à quo, <hi>or a propenſion to ſome other place, as the</hi> terminus ad quem: <hi>If they ſay the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is true that then</hi> B. <hi>ought to

               <p>And to your Argument likewiſe, or the conſequence that flows neceſſarily and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally from it; for from the premiſſes it concludes naturally, (not what you inferr from it) but that which is according to ſence and experience; <hi>viz.</hi> that B. being at D. ſhould go to E. not to A. if the cauſe of its riſing be a propenſion to the higher place, as <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> of its motion: becauſe A. is not higher than E; for if it were ſo, the line C. B. A. would be longer than the line C. E. which is contrary to ſence, and to the Principles themſelves, of what you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Maſter, <hi>viz.</hi> Mathematicks; which teach that all the right lines drawn from the center of a Circle, as ſuppoſe A.E.F. to its own circumference, are equal among themſelves; and <hi>per</hi> conſequent D. needs not to go towards A. to attain the higher place; but ought to go ſtraight to E. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as high as A. and the next higher place to D. as juſt over it: except you ſhew ſome reaſon (to make your Argument rational, and more plauſible) why the ſmoak of a Candle, for inſtance, burning upon the floor at one end of the long Gallery in <hi>Oxford,</hi> ought to black the cieling thereof (which

And then, when you have ſhewed this, change (to make your conſequence flow neceſſarily from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes) one of the terms of the Argument, ſaying, for and inſtead of the higher place, (as it ſaith) the higheſt point in that place: for if the higher place, not the higheſt point therein, be <hi>terminus ad quem</hi> of the natural motion and propenſion of the Air, you may with as much reaſon, inferr a motion of D. to F. as to the place A. ſince A. is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing higher than F. and neither of them higher in the Sphere than E: E.

Secondly, you make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one point higheſt in the World: which point higher than the reſt, being not found in a Sphere, but in a Conical Figure or a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, you make a Pyramid of the World; which is ſo great and rare a diſcovery, that

               <p>Another famous Author in the Epiſcopal Church, who for his much Learning, and making of many Books in <hi>Babylonical</hi> Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and knowledge, deſerves to be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or at leaſt to be named with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Vicars, the incomparable <hi>Boyle,</hi> among others his many vexations of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, which he calls Experiments, hath given us, to confirm our Sages opinion of a deſcent and countergravitation of the Air, one of very large glaſs Bubbles, ſealed Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically, hung at one end of a Beam, and juſtly counterpoized with a Metalline coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoize at the other: which, ſuſpended at a frame, <hi>ſhews not all the various changes of the Air,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that were conſpicuous in another Weather-glaſs,</hi> which he had placed by it; <hi>yet confirms</hi> ad oculum <hi>that the falling and riſing of the</hi> Mercury, <hi>depends upon the varying weight of the</hi> Atmoſphere, <hi>and ſhews that the Air hath weight, ſince in this ſtatical Weather-glaſs</hi> (for ſo he calls theſe ſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoized Bubbles) <hi>it cannot be pretended that a</hi> Fuga vacui, <hi>or a</hi> Funiculus <hi>is the cauſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40429:74"/>of the changes which he obſerved therein: for I had the pleaſure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſee the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſometimes in an</hi> Aequilibrium <hi>with the counterpoize, and ſometimes, when the</hi> Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere <hi>was high,</hi> (he means thereby leſs heavy) <hi>preponderate ſo manifeſtly that, the Beam being gently ſtirred, the Cock would play altogether on that ſide at which the Bubbles were hung; and at other times, (when the Air was heavier) that which was at the first but the counterpoize, would preponderate, and, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the motion of the Beam, make the Cock vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate altogether on its ſide;</hi> with ſo much of pretty ſport or ſatisfaction to ſo grave and honourable Author, that I am very loth to go about to ſpoil it; leſt I ſhould at one time <hi>excitare crabrones</hi> in too great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and multitude againſt me.</p>
               <p>However getting never the more Enemies for it, I will venture to ſay that it appears not clearly to my dull apprehenſion, that becauſe <hi>Fuga vacui</hi> cannot be counted the cauſe of the various changes he ſaw in his ſtatical Baroſcope, or Weather-glaſs, the weight of the Air therefore ought to be the cauſe of it; chiefly if the Beam muſt be ſtirred, (as he confeſſeth it was, though
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40429:75"/>
                  <hi>gently,</hi> adds he, as though this gentle ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring were nothing to ſuch Beam) to make the Cock play on this or that ſide of the <hi>Anſa:</hi> becauſe I can aſſign another cauſe, as likely at leaſt as either of them, to wit, the condenſation and the rarefaction of the Air by heat and cold. For, even according to one Hydroſtatical Law, which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor owns and makes mention of in the ſame page from which I have taken the things I cite of him, (which Law, as he calls it, is, if the <hi>medium</hi> wherein two Bodies of equal weight, but unequal bulk, are weigh'd, be more denſe than another; (ſuch as Water, for inſtance, which is more denſe than the Air) the greater Body being ſpecifically lighter, and finding more reſiſtance becauſe of its greater bulk, than the leſſer and more compact, as the counterpoize; will loſe more of its own weight, or be more eaſily born up, or buoyed up therein, than in the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>medium:</hi> but if the ſame <hi>medium</hi> be thinner than another, or than it was it ſelf before, and at other times, as the Air which is thinner than Water, and at ſome times more rarefied than before; then the bigger Body, ceaſing to be ſuſtained by the former
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40429:75"/>reſiſtance, will ſink lower than before, and ſo outweigh the leſſer) the condenſed Air being thicker, reſiſts better than when it is more rarefied, and ſo bears up the large Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles better and higher therefore than their leſſer counterpoize: ſo that this riſing and fall of his Bubbles, confirms rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation and the rarefaction of the Air, than any ſuch weight thereof as that he aſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibes to it. For though, as I confeſs, the thickneſs of a <hi>medium</hi> is an argument it hath a greater ſpecifick weight, than hath a thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>medium:</hi> yet, as it is moſt certain that vapours have no deſcent and gravitation, before they condenſe into a much cloſer texture than the Air hath at any time with us, though they are not without their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive weight all that while; ſo we ought not in reaſon, for the Air being ſomewhat more denſe than it was before, and however much thinner than is vaporized Oyl, Water, or <hi>Mercury,</hi> aſcribe to it that ſenſible deſcent and gravitation which this learned Author, and other Sages plead for: Who ſhould ſhew that the riſing and fall of the Bubbles, comes from the greater or leſſer deſcent of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> upon and round about them,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40429:76"/>before they take it thus for granted; and then likewiſe ſhew further how, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes to paſs that the Air, when it is become ſomewhat heavier than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth not gravitate and preſs upon the larger Body with ſo much the greater force, by how much the greater Atmoſpherical Column incumbent upon the ſame is more encreaſed in weight, than that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon the leſſer Body; and ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of cauſing the Bubbles to riſe higher, (as the Author ſaith he had the pleaſure to ſee plainly) cauſe them to over-bear their Metalline counterpoize, and to fall down much lower than they were before the Airs encreaſe of gravitation: as from the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this diligent Author, who being told of a Miſt, ſent to ſee whether the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were buoyed up by the greater heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Air had then, but did not learn that they were, it may be conjectured they did; and if they did not, but kept in the ſame ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is however enough to invalidate the conſequence he draws from his Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law; for thereby in moiſt weather, as in miſty and foggy, the Air being then heavier than before, they ought to riſe.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:40429:76"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Great improvements may be made of this,</hi> adds the ſame Author: as Firſt, <hi>that inſtead of a Braſs or Leaden counterpoize, rich men may get one of Gold:</hi> Secondly, <hi>that if the ſame counterpoize be made of Praſs or of Lead, it will be leſs ſubject to rust, than Iron:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>if this Inſtrument be placed in a ſmall frame, like a ſquare Lanthorn, with glaſs win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows about it, it will be more free from dust. To which accommodations divers others</hi> (much like them) <hi>may be,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſuggeſted; and ſo this Experiment, and the like, much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a conſideration of the nature of the thing.</hi> Which having therefore taken into conſideration, I humbly ſuggeſt that theſe Experiments, being (1.) <hi>de Bullis ampliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> (2.) and <hi>ab ampliſſimo authore B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LLA facta,</hi> (3.) and conſider'd in themſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in my opinion the glorious Latine Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Ter Bullatae</hi> (that is, moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent) <hi>Nugae.</hi> A rare invention indeed, and like to do much ſervice, which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go alone; nor, when moved and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhew, as he doth not deny, ſo much as the Mercurial Weather-glaſs, which is it ſelf but a very imperfect and unuſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention!</p>

               <p>Thus, theſe Sages on one ſide, and the Vicars and other Church-men on the other ſide, concur and run together blindfold to heap up a deal of Non-ſence and confuſion, and to feed the ſtupid World with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and untruth.

               <p>But, to conclude the diſcourſe concerning the Weather-glaſs, before I go further, I judge it convenient to add to what hath been ſaid of the cauſe of the Column riſing to its uſual height, this more exact account, and further reaſon of it: to wit, that the World, being a coherent Plenitude, <hi>&amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium corporum ordo &amp; distributio,</hi> (whence it is called <hi>Mundus</hi>) admits of no <hi>vacuum,</hi> and its parts of no <hi>chaſma</hi> within, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves; and not only its ſaid parts (ſuch as the Earth, the Water, and the Air) ſtand in a due proportion to each other, as <hi>Solomon</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 42.25. but all other things likewiſe are diſtributed therein in order, that is, by weight, by number, rule, and meaſure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.10. (without which its fine order cannot be long preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) from whence, a certain portion of ſpace hath been meaſured, and a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of weight aſſigned to each in their common receptacle and lodging, the place
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40429:80"/>of all created Bodies, the World; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion they cannot extend beyond or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, without an inconvenience repugnant to their order, and to the perfect wiſdom of their Almighty Maker: and ſo the Air (as being one of the moſt bulky Bodies and parts of this World) cannot reach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſpace, nor exceed the <hi>pondus molis</hi> allowed unto it, nor ſtretch it ſelf in one place, except part thereof doth ſhrink and condenſe in another; nor move from its place, except another Body makes room, and either part of it ſelf, or ſome other next Fluid follows and ſucceeds to it: much leſs can the next Fluid go beyond it in theſe things, whilſt it is <hi>aſcending</hi> like it, to be its Vicar; that is, exceed the <hi>pondus molis</hi> which the Air ſhould have, if it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into as cloſe a texture as it (the next Fluid) hath; and extend beyond the ſpace which is allowed to the Air: as it would, if what riſeth of it to ſucceed and to ſupply the place of the Air, that is, the Column thereof, ſhould riſe to a greater height than that it uſually hath: for then it would have more weight, and (if rarefied into as looſe and thin a texture and conſiſtence as the Air)
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40429:80"/>not only take up more room than comes to the ſhare and proportion of the Air, but extend beyond the bounds ſet to the Sphere of the Air, and with it, to all other more denſe and heavy Bodies: which were more inconvenient than ſuch inconſiderable <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> and disjunction, as that which can be by all the skill and power of man introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the World. And therefore, though the World is a coherent Plenitude, which admits naturally of neither vacuity, nor <hi>chaſma</hi> or ſolution of its continuity; yet, ſuch <hi>vacuum</hi> being a far leſs inconvenience than were the riſing of the Column higher than it doth, the diſcreet <hi>ordo mundi,</hi> which is a Law thereunto, will rather admit of it, as the leſs, than of the worſe; and ſo, to avoid the worſe, it ſuffers the Column to riſe in due proportion to the weight of the Fluid whereof it is a Vicar; and provides at the ſame time, that the derelicted ſpace ſhall not be abſolutely empty, but only in part; by cauſing the Air, which is pent up between the Column and the Pipe, to rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and to dilate it ſelf ſo as to ſupply in part the ſaid derelicted ſpace: (for, note well that when the Pipe is filled with <hi>Mercury,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:40429:81"/>the Air is not all driven out of it, but ſome ſmall bubbles thereof remain included be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Mercury</hi> and the Pipe, which may be ſeen by diſtinct ſpots round about, and from the top to the Baſe of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Column; and which, when the Column ſinks, ſubſide not along with it, but enter in the void ſpace as faſt as the <hi>Mercury</hi> that pent them againſt the Pipe leaves it void by ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.) And as a greater void ſpace hath a circumference greater than a leſſer ſpace, and ſo yields, <hi>ratione ſuarum diametrorum,</hi> more place for the <hi>Mercury</hi> to pent up more bubbles of Air againſt it than the leſſer, ſo it is ſupplied as much: and needs not <hi>per</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent (if it were able to draw) draw more, and make the Column riſe higher, in proportion to its greater height or depth; as our modern Sages have in their great School-wiſdom argued that it ought to do: affirming that the Ancients were ſo dull and ſo ſilly as to think it <hi>would do ſo;</hi> and as not to be aware of ſome weight and gravity in the Air when compreſſed: though ſome of the Ancients have ſhewed them that not only they well knew the contrary, but, even without the help of their long kenning
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40429:81"/>Spectacles, ſaw as far again as they; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>aequipondium</hi> of Fluids <hi>in aſcenſu,</hi> or whilſt they are aſcending, as the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Column hath before been ſhewed to do, and their mutual ſucceeding and relieving each other <hi>per neceſſitatem Divinam;</hi> which is a great ſecret, to our Divine.

But, leſt this diſcourſe ſhould ſwell to a greater bulk, than that I at firſt intended, I do referr this to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all rational Teachers, and all true Authors of Books, appealing even to <hi>Boyle,</hi> and to <hi>Wallis</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> and others Univerſity-Pillars, and great Princes of their Sect, for the uſe they make of them, and for the good theſe do them in compoſing their Sermons and Books of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.

               <p>Verily, the firſt entrance, or initiation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the myſteries of the kingdom of Heaven, begins at the ſingleneſs of eye and humility uſual to a little child, who is not ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, nor pre-poſſeſs'd with any prejudice and opinions, but receives what he is taught, and endeavours both to learn and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it well, without murmuring at it, and arguing againſt it, and deriding his Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as the proud <hi>Phariſees</hi> did: for as by Pride <hi>Adam</hi> fell from knowledge and righteouſneſs, (which two the Image of

Out of pride, Angels and man fell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into Hell, (which is <hi>in outer darkneſs,</hi> whereas <hi>the inheritance of Saints in the light,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.12. <hi>within,</hi> Luk. 17.21. doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from a <hi>ſingle eye,</hi> Mat. 6.22.) and out of pride, Clergy-men are the firſt in all Ages, and among all parties, that <hi>reject,</hi> and make others reject <hi>the counſel of God:</hi> and it is to be obſerved, that upon this ſame account the Clergy is the Author, and hath ever been Author of all the perſecutions that have
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40429:88"/>been for Religion, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.8, 44, 45. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.13. as it was typified, by <hi>Levi</hi> ſlaying <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechem,</hi> with all their men, on no other pretence but, <hi>why ſhould he deal with our Sister</hi> (that is, our Church) <hi>as</hi> though ſhe were <hi>a Harlot?</hi> Gen. 34.31. Which the Proteſtant <hi>Levi, brother in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> to the old Chriſtian <hi>Levi,</hi> that is, the Popiſh Clergy, is upon the ſame account as ready to act likewiſe, that is, to ſlay any man that makes ſo bold as to ſhew that their Church is a Harlot, and to ſpeak againſt that which ever made <hi>the Prieſts heart glad,</hi> Judg. 18.18, 20. Indeed not immediately, no more than <hi>Levi</hi> their type; but like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> (who did not ſet upon Chriſt at firſt ſight to deſtroy him, whence the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thought him mad when he did (becauſe he knew the hearts of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and foreſaw what the pride thereof would drive them into, <hi>John</hi> 2.25.) tax them for it long before <hi>they went about to do it, John</hi> 7.19, 20.) by degrees, as by calling him firſt the <hi>worſt of Christians, the Agent of the Devil,</hi> a Fool, <hi>an Enthuſiaſt,</hi> and (if they cannot anſwer what he ſaith) a Blaſphemer, a <hi>Beelzebub, Mat.</hi> 10.25. and at laſt, perſecute him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40429:89"/>which is what I look for at their hands, when they know me.</p>
               <p>Neither is the ſaid knowledge of Chriſt, and how to preach him, to be learned out of Books, as from the teſtimony of the Word of Prophecy, from the relation of <hi>Paul, Luke, Matthew,</hi> or from reaſons or arguments drawn from thence by one man for another; but as in the dark only: they ſerving us but <hi>until the bright and the morning Star,</hi> and <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> the holy Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>that teſtifieth of him,</hi> John 15.26. — 5.32. and that <hi>teacheth men all things, dawns</hi> and ſhines <hi>in our hearts,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. for when <hi>that Sun is riſen upon</hi> earthly-minded Souls, they enter into <hi>Zoar,</hi> Gen. 19.23. (the turning of the Anger, and the beginning of <hi>the Love of God ſhed in their hearts,</hi> by the Spirit of knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5.) knowing Chriſt then, not becauſe of the words of other men, but by reaſon that themſelves have alſo within themſelves the ſame teacher others had; which by enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their minds, doth perſwade and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, by the ſame reaſons he did ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to thoſe other men, <hi>that he is</hi> indeed <hi>the Chriſt and the Saviour of the World,</hi> John

Otherwiſe unto this day, <hi>when Chriſt, or Moſes is read, a vail is upon their hearts,</hi> which is not <hi>taken away</hi> but by a true <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto the Lord, the Spirit;</hi> by the which we <hi>are changed from glory and</hi> from knowledge, <hi>to glory and</hi> to knowledge, into the glorious Image of God in knowledge, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17, 18. and if the Scripture be true, no man comes to the knowledge of the Son, but <hi>he to whom the Son will reveal</hi> himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.22. <hi>John</hi> 10: 30. — 14.9. The Revelation of Chriſt, (or the knowledge of Chriſt to be revealed to man) is written unto the <hi>ſeven</hi> true <hi>Churches</hi> only, that is, to the only true members of the Church of Chriſt, and <hi>ſealed with ſeven ſeals,</hi> Rev. 1.1. — 5.1. <hi>No man in heaven or earth but the Lamb,</hi> who hath and ſends the ſeven Spirits of God, whereby he doth make us Prieſts, that we need no more be taught of Prieſts, being taught of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34: <hi>can open or look therein, Rev.</hi> 3.7. Surely, the knowledge of Chriſt puzzleth the Angels themſelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. much more <hi>men who are born like the</hi> dull <hi>Colt of a wild Aſs,</hi> Job 11.12. <hi>and dwell in houſes of clay,</hi> ch. 4.19. and who <hi>having never ſeen

So that no natural man, (ſuch as all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> are by nature) as he never ſaw or knew the inviſible Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all things, the Deity; can ſee, that is, know the Son who is inviſible alſo, from the bare teſtimony of the holy men of God: but the ſpiritual man only, which is born of God, and able therefore, <hi>John</hi> 6.46. to ſearch even <hi>the deep things of God,</hi> knows the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Son, and underſtands this <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wiſdom,</hi> the knowledge of them; which is a great <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> but indeed a great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, to the School-men, and other learned <hi>Princes</hi> of this world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>John</hi> 14.7. <hi>fleſh and bloud,</hi> or all the skill and learning carnal men have, <hi>cannot make known</hi> unto them the Son of the living God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>but the Father:</hi> witneſs thoſe whom the Lord ſpake theſe words to, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apoſtles themſelves: who, though they were taught of him, <hi>for when they were alone he expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto them all things,</hi> which concerned the myſteries of his kingdom, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.11, 34.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40429:90"/>yet not only for ſome time after they had been with him, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.18. but even when they had heard all that which he was to preach and teach them by word of mouth, <hi>John</hi> 16.12. — 17.4. that is, after that he was riſen again from the dead, far from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it, they underſtood not ſo much as that the Scriptures foretold or meant any thing of it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25, 45. <hi>John</hi> 20.9. until their underſtandings were opened by Chriſt breathing the Holy Ghoſt upon them, <hi>v.</hi> 22. And much leſs therefore can we, who are not only as blind and dull as the Apoſtles were before their ſecond birth, but never converſed with, and never were taught of Chriſt, but of ſuch ignorant men as we are; underſtand Chriſt, the Goſpel of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and what the Scripture teacheth, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Apoſtles, before <hi>the eyes of our dark minds or underſtandings are enlightned,</hi> as theirs were, <hi>by the Spirit of wiſdom and of revelation for the acknowledgement of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.17, 18.</p>
               <p>This is worth obſervation: and becauſe this very thing was denied by Eſquire <hi>Boyle,</hi> and ſome ſuch other learned Scribblers of Divinity, I think it not amiſs to obſerve yet
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40429:91"/>further, that, although the Apoſtles had ſeen Chriſt ſtill the winds and waves, cauſe the Fig-tree to wither, and twice multiply the bread, yet they were ſo <hi>ſlow of heart</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or believe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25. that not only they could not do the leaſt ſign in his name, but did not believe him able, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking thought or care for the bread that periſheth, and for the leaven thereof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.11. to preſerve them from ſtarving: and that he calls them <hi>faithleſs,</hi> v. 8. Mark 9.19. uſing theſe expreſſions almoſt on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>viz. how is it ye have no faith?</hi> Mark 4.40. <hi>Are ye alſo,</hi> like the world, <hi>ſo without underſtanding?</hi> ch. 7, 18. Mat. 15.16. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye not yet, neither underſtand?</hi> Mat. 8.17. <hi>how is it that ye do not yet understand?</hi> v.21.— 9.32. and are ſo ſenſual and groſs, that you <hi>ſavour not the things of God, but the things of men?</hi> Mat. 16.23. From whence, if they that heard his doctrine out of his own mouth, that were conſtant beholders of his wonders and miracles, and were to be, what they did become ſince, great and chief men among the true believers, could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no better (until they had received the gift of the holy Ghoſt) the things which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40429:91"/>they ſaw and heard; what reaſon have we to think, that they who are born, nay bred at the Univerſities, <hi>like the Colt of a wild Aſs,</hi> Job 11.12. do believe and underſtand the ſame things better than they, when they can no more than they, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.19. do the leaſt Chriſtian virtue; and reliſh the things of God, ſo much as to deny their vile paſſions in the leaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. and leave, upon the account of his promiſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. Houſes, Lands, Country, Parents and Children for his ſake, and the Goſpels? for who among the preſent Preachers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, doth leave and venture even the uncertain hope he hath of a mean ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, to go and preach the Goſpel, not in <hi>Turky,</hi> or in <hi>Spain,</hi> (as <hi>Tillotſon</hi> doth object to ſome that diſſent from him) but in <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, Virginia,</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey;</hi> where they may do it without danger, and find more hearers ready prepared for them, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to allow ſomething for their ſubſiſtence, than ſome of thoſe great many who flock from all parts of the Country to <hi>London,</hi> as the beſt Market-place to <hi>make merchandize</hi> of their Sermons, <hi>and Souls of men</hi> in, Rev. 18.13. Gal. 4.17. do meet with in many
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40429:92"/>years. And if for <hi>ſaying theſe things,</hi> ſome of them ſhould ſay to me, as the Lawyers ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.45. <hi>thou reproachest us alſo:</hi> let them <hi>ſhew me</hi> by <hi>their deeds,</hi> Act. 19.18. how much they believe better than the ſaid ſpectators of Chriſt his works of wonders, <hi>John</hi> 10.38. that they need not <hi>to take thought for what they ſhall eat or drink,</hi> and that Chriſt would be as good as his word, if they did but <hi>ſeek firſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Mat. 6.31, 33. for God is <hi>no accepter of perſons,</hi> and of parties: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth thoſe things, is no more excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than they whom my diſcourſe is chiefly intended againſt. Nay let them ſhew me that Sect, which is not as ready as thoſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.38. <hi>to forbid</hi> true believers to ſhew by their acts of Faith that they do truly believe, except they <hi>follow,</hi> that is, become of one Sect with them, and receive from them the ſame token and name of the Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Therefore this underſtanding, knowledge and belief on Chriſt, being not obtained by the ſtrength of wit and learning, nor from the Scriptures alone, even when preached by Chriſt himſelf to the Apoſtles, but by the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40429:92"/>help of the light of the holy Spirit of God, which is his free gift, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11. <hi>John</hi> 6.65. how ſay the Vicar and <hi>Hales,</hi> that all Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers have a great neceſſity of Learning; and that <hi>otherwiſe than out of the Apoſtles and other holy mens Books, the Spirit ſpeaks not to men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now (to return to the main ſubject in hand) it appears from the manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the extraordinary Spirit in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that all Chriſtian believers do feel the ſame in themſelves; and that it is no more than what they may pretend to, even the Biſhops themſelves, or Vicars being Judges: for they ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. that <hi>whenever any man experiences the genuine operation of the</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spirit under the Goſpel, <hi>he finds a vaſt alteration in the ſtate of his mind, his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of things are far different from their former ſelves, when he was under the command of lust and prejudice; he then better ſees the nature of things, and thoſe ſeveral excellencies that are in them: he pitches upon objects which are every way more agreeable to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, as well as neceſſities of his Soul, than the husks he formerly fed upon:</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 9. they ſay, that <hi>its buſineſs is to enlighten our
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40429:93"/>dark faculties, whereby we may ſee the beauty and excellency of thoſe divine objects that are propoſed to our underſtandings, to ſtrengthen our good purpoſes for an holy life, and to excite our affections to a love agreeable,</hi> &amp;c. So that even from this ſame deſcription of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaid ordinary Spirit, by Maſter Vicar, (which makes it almoſt the ſame as that which I have ſhewed was ſeen in the Apoſtles) it follows, that the ſame extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Spirit the Apoſtles had, is found in all Believers; and that therefore in reſpect of them that believe in Chriſt, it is but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: and ſo, that the diſtinction of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary Spirit among Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as not grounded in Scripture, is erroneous and falſe: and an old Sophiſm hammer'd, even from the time of 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. in the ſhop of Antichriſt, <hi>who denies the coming of Christ</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt, to us whilſt yet <hi>in the fieſh:</hi> binding the ſtrong influence of it in the believers, or limiting its power to the meaſure of his own Spirit, <hi>which is not ſo great,</hi> v. 4. giving out that any but the ſame he hath, is ceaſed: and thus by reducing the mighty Spirit ſome have, to the level of his own mean ordinary Spirit,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40429:93"/>doth (to the withſtanding of the kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.17. which <hi>is in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14.17. that he may preſerve his own Earthly kingdom, which conſiſts in meer beaſtly affections, and a brutiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) what he can to keep from men the knowledge of their moſt excellent Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: thereby to make them ſit ſtill conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and without ſenſe of their baſe deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, <hi>in the ſhadow of</hi> that <hi>death</hi> all men dye of with <hi>Adam,</hi> from the very firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their life, until the time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. O that Chriſtians were but left to their reaſon and Scripture in matters of Religion! for who is he, though never ſo careleſs of his future and eternal happineſs, that would not be glad, and ſtrive with all his power and might to obtain the gift of that which ſhews <hi>and teacheth all things,</hi> if he knew he might have it? But <hi>woe be to you Doctors,</hi> who, notwithſtanding your fair pretence to the contrary, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. do your endeavour <hi>to keep</hi> (by impoſing upon them your Doctrines and Traditions) from men <hi>the key of knowledge,</hi> Deut. 27.18. and would ſcarce have allowed them any ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were not the exiſtence of Gods Spirit
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40429:94"/>in the Church ſo plainly taught in Scripture, that you dare not deny it! But yet a little while, and you will not ſtick to ſay, that both your ordinary and extraordinary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are wholly ceaſed; if the two witneſſes of God, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt <hi>that teſtifieth of him,</hi> John 15.26. — 5 32. <hi>and the cloud of witneſſes,</hi> both recorded in Scriptures; and not recorded, to wit, thoſe that have been and are ſtill ſince the ſame were written) having already propheſied out near their time of 1260 years, hidden under their <hi>ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,</hi> do not prevent you quickly, <hi>by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their feet, and killing the beast that</hi> hath ſo long made War againſt them, <hi>killed and overcome them;</hi> that <hi>the kingdoms of this</hi> world may at laſt <hi>become the Lords,</hi> Rev 11.15. Obad. 21.</p>
               <p>Pray, had not the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church ſuch Spirit as you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. is continued to Chriſtians, <hi>viz. ſufficiently helpful to them, ſuitable to their neceſſities, and to what God required of them in order to be partakers of his bleſſings?</hi> and did they not underſtand as much of their Religion, and of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as you of yours, and of him? that is, (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the place above cited out of <hi>Hales,</hi> viz.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40429:94"/>
                  <hi>that otherwiſe than out of the Apoſtles books, the Spirit ſpeaks not to you</hi>) as much as was related out of the Law, and of the ancient Prophets Books to them? and ſo, what doth the Spirit you pretend to, amount to? what greater priviledge have Chriſtians than they by it? what ſignifies Chriſt's coming, and their being anointed thereby for his Kings and Prieſts; dignities granted but to few men in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church? what ſignifies the promiſe which God made, that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be bleſſed by the ſaid coming of the <hi>Meſſiah?</hi> and in ſhort, what ſignifies the Prophecy in your Text? <hi>In the last days I will pour my Spirit on all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall prophecy,</hi> (viz. by it) <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17, 18. Now were the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days more the laſt days than ours? and were only they and their children meant here by all fleſh? or elſe are <hi>as many</hi> meant, according to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> v. 39. <hi>as the Lord ſhall</hi> ever <hi>call</hi> unto the end of the World?</p>
               <p>And to ſee which of <hi>Peter,</hi> or your Church, is in the right; that is, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, his or yours, is Orthodox: will you be pleaſed, my Lords, to be tryed here
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40429:95"/>by your Peers; (for you will grant, I hope, that the Biſhops of <hi>Antioch, Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. were as good men as you are; and that we may as well ſay, my Lord <hi>Paul,</hi> my Lord <hi>Peter.</hi> my Lord St. <hi>John,</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> Biſhop, Archbiſhop, Primate, Patriarch, and Cardinal, and Pope, (except you grudge them the ſame honour the Papiſts allow them, who ſay <hi>Peter</hi> was one, and chief amongſt them) as ſay, <hi>my Lord of</hi> London, Henry <hi>the Right Reverend Father in God,</hi> to no man) and to allow of their ſentence out of Scripture Law, as well as <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and other Apoſtles did? <hi>Act.</hi> 15.19, 15, 22, 28. Hoping which, I ſay firſt, that St. <hi>John</hi> by applying the promiſes of Chriſt concerning the Holy Ghoſt <hi>teaching all things,</hi> &amp;c. John 14.26, 16, 13. to all thoſe he wrote to, (all Chriſtians generally) 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20, 27. ſhews that they do not belong to the Apoſtles only, (as <hi>Hales,</hi> and you out of him, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. <hi>lin.</hi> 20. ſeem to take it for granted) but to all them that believe in Chriſt, <hi>who ſhould,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 7.39. <hi>receive the holy Spirit after Chriſt was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> which ſhould make the knowledge of all things to riſe and ſpring (like <hi>wells of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40429:95"/>living waters flowing out of their belly</hi>) from their heart within themſelves. And it is moſt evident that theſe Promiſes of Chriſt were meant to all his diſciples, that is, all that learn of him, ſince he did ſpeak to them all, as appears by <hi>John</hi> 15.8. and by his new commandment given them at the ſame time, <hi>ch.</hi> 13.34. — 15.12. which no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will deny but that it doth belong to all the diſciples of Chriſt, and not to ſome few of them: and ſince Chriſt himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>Mark</hi> 13 3, 37. that <hi>what he ſpake</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> was ſpoken <hi>unto all the</hi> Servants of the <hi>Son of man,</hi> v. 34. and all them that are to <hi>watch.</hi> And we find accordingly, that not only ſome few great Believers in ſome Churches, but that all the Believers, and the whole Chriſtian Churches received the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt, to begin at the viſible deſcent thereof, and with the firſt Chriſtian Church: The Apoſtles were no more than twelve in number, and yet hundred and twenty diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples received the Holy Ghoſt on the day of <hi>Pentecost, Act.</hi> 1.14, 15. for, as in the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> verſe, <hi>they were all with one accord,</hi> and

               <p>From all which it moſt clearly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appears, that the Holy Ghoſt is given to all the faithful: and the diſtinction of the Vicar in the gift of it, to wit, his ordinary and extraordinary gift, appearing no where at all; the Scriptures ſpeaking but of one ſort of Spirit given; nay teaching that God being no reſpecter of perſons, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. <hi>puts no</hi> ſuch <hi>difference</hi> at all <hi>between</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ch. 15.9. <hi>in every Nation he that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.14. not ſee this; and deny that the Lords Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops having been fairly tryed and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by as good men as their Peers, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had as good Law as the Statutes or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Scripture could afford them, the gift of the Holy Ghoſt continues ſtill in Gods Church; and ſay that it is ceaſed, and that no man, ever ſince 400 years after the times of the Apoſtles, hath right to pretend to it? But if ſome ſtill contend for their ordinary Spirit, (thus holding ſuch <hi>Goſpel as</hi> the Saints <hi>have not preached,</hi> Gal. 1.8) let them have it in Gods name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. for ſo, inſtead of being reformed to the Image of God that created man, (not after two Images, to wit, an ordinary and extraordinary one, for God being always the ſame, hath but one Image) they muſt remain deformed; and they can have but a mean Salvation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: becauſe Salvation being in and through the Holy Ghoſt, as was ſaid out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. he that hath but a mean and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40429:101"/>ordinary ſhare of it, hath but an ordinary power to do good works with, and ſo hath but a mean and ordinary righteouſneſs; and God rendring unto men but according to their works, the peace and joy, or the bliſs (which Salvation conſiſts in) that they do receive from thence, cannot therefore be but mean, and very ordinary: like unto the old third ſtate, or <hi>Limbus;</hi> a reward fit for our Right Reverend Fathers in God; to be it.</p>
               <p>And here I had left them, and finiſhed my diſcourſe, but that hearing ſome of them <hi>à Limbo Patrum</hi> crying, alas we did not know that theſe things were meant of this life, but thought that the promiſes made to all the believers, concerning the gift of the Spirit conferred on them, were to begin upon the diſſolution of their fleſh: neither did we underſtand any thing of a ſecond coming of Chriſt in Spirit, to men, for their Salvation; but took his ſecond coming to be in Judgment only, at the ſound of the laſt Trump, when he comes with his Angels to judge the quick and the dead! I think it convenient to ſhew likewiſe that it is in this life, before men dye, that the gift of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40429:102"/>Spirit is conferred upon them: and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that when the Holy Ghoſt is ſent, or comes, it is the ſecond coming of Chriſt, Chriſt comes then himſelf; that I may both fully diſcharge the task I have taken upon me this day, and leave them without excuſe that are detained, and that keep others in the <hi>Limbus</hi> of ſuch groſs ignorance.</p>
               <p>But firſt, (to prevent miſtakes) I deſire the Reader to take notice, that I have ſaid nothing tending to eſtabliſh the doctrine or opinion of an equality of Spirit among be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; as though every member of Chriſt's m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtical body, or every believer, had an equal ſhare or part of Spirit with thoſe that are inſtead of eyes, ears, and of the other ſenſes to it. No, I have from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and in ſome other places of the foregoing pages, inferred the contrary: and I only aſſert, that the Holy Ghoſt being given to all the faithful, even in the ſame manner as unto the Apoſtles, they may by knocking, asking, praying, and by watching ſo as to purifie themſelves, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. from that which defileth man, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. ſerve God in ſuch holineſs, and walk in ſuch righteouſneſs before him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40429:102"/>to obtain as great a portion and gift thereof, as the Apoſtles. And this grounded, beſides the inſtances we have of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.35, 46. — 19.6. upon the promiſes of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. that <hi>they which ſhall follow him in the regeneration, and overcome</hi> the ſeventh time, that is to ſay, to the end, <hi>ſhall ſit with him in his Throne,</hi> as well as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; <hi>ſhall partake</hi> as much as they <hi>of Gods</hi> own <hi>divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>ſhall be one with God</hi> himſelf, John 17.21. or <hi>tranſibit in Deum,</hi> as the Right Reverend Doctor <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> ſaid. For note that, though Chriſts promiſe makes mention but of twelve Thrones, it extends nevertheleſs further than to the twelve men who were then ſpeaking with him: as appears firſt, from the words themſelves of the ſaid promiſe, which are, <hi>you that follow me,</hi> or <hi>that ſhall follow me in the regeneration;</hi> and not, <hi>you my Apoſtles that have followed me,</hi> as the Tranſlator mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes; (for none of the Apoſtles had as yet followed Chriſt in the regeneration, but were ſtill to do it then; being not till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when Chriſt was glorified, born again of the Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 7.39.) and which ſhew that the promiſe belongs to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40429:103"/>upon condition only; (for pray, ſhall <hi>Judas</hi> ſit with the reſt upon a Throne?) and ſo <hi>to you</hi> Lords Biſhops, if you will but dye to your Lordſhips worldly-mindedneſs, to follow in the new birth your Lord, and to them likewiſe that have and ſhall accompliſh and perform that condition: and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſecondly, from the forementioned place of <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. which ſaith, not <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, but <hi>he that overcometh, ſhall ſit with me in my Throne,</hi> and ſo doth confirm this ſence: And thirdly, from that Chriſt would not promiſe any of them the firſt ſeats in his Kingdom; but they ſhall have them, ſaith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.23. <hi>for whom ſuch reward is prepared of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as he who knows which of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhall deſerve it beſt. Verily I dare ſay, that as many as ſhall wade through the red Sea of their bloud, <hi>Luk</hi> 22.44. and the other deep waters of tribulations with Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. ſhall ſit with him on twelve Thrones, that is, get the brighteſt Crown of glory, or higheſt ſtate among the twelve Tribes; that is, among the whole multitude, or the compleat number of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. And though this is not meant of, nor
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40429:103"/>attainable in this life, yet Salvation being <hi>in and through the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14 17. and being <hi>rendred to man</hi> but <hi>according to his works,</hi> which he hath done in this life, an adequate proportion, or ſupply of the Spirit proportionable unto his degree of future glory, and capable to procure it, is required in this life, and muſt be got before death. Beſides, not <hi>Peter</hi> and the other. Apoſtles only, but whoever <hi>is righteous, ſhall ſhine as the Firmament;</hi> and if any man <hi>ſhould turn</hi> more men <hi>to righteouſneſs,</hi> than the greateſt Apoſtles, he ſhould ſhine brighter than they, <hi>as the Sun</hi> above the <hi>Stars in the kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Dan. 12.3. Mat. 13.43. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Believers do not purifie themſelves to that degree of brightneſs or holineſs that ſome do, therefore in the Fathers houſe (which is the Holy Ghoſt, as I have ſhewed before) there be ſeveral manſions, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. diſtinguiſhable from the ſtate and the proportion of Faith the faithful ſhall be found with; and not diſtinguiſhed by any place aſſigned, or ſtate before-hand decreed for them, as <hi>Babel</hi> teacheth: ſo that any righteous man that will live by Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in going from Faith to Faith, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40429:104"/>up with wings as Eagles, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of knocking, asking, watching, and of waiting on the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.7. may not only preſs into <hi>Zion,</hi> the kingdom of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16. but take by force even the higheſt ſeat that is in it; as, I doubt not, many have done ſince the Apoſtles, and ſhall do to the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>That the Holy Ghoſt is ſent and given during this life, or whilſt we are in the fleſh, and before we taſte of death, to them that prepare themſelves for Salvation, it appears from <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. where, if we open the door, hear Chriſts voice, and keep his Word, (which is done during this life) Chriſt will come by his Spirit, and make his abode with us. <hi>Behold I come quickly,</hi> had not been repeated three divers times in the laſt chapter of all the Scriptures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.7, 12, 20. if that coming were meant of Chriſts coming in Judgment; for that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deferred already near a third part of the age of the World, that is, near two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, is far from a quick coming; and ſo it is another coming by the Holy Ghoſt which St. <hi>John</hi> meant in that place.

Where note, that from that the World ſees Chriſt no more afterwards, from his firſt diſappearance at his paſſion and burial; whilſt the Apoſtles ſee him again, and that by reaſon that he went to the Father, it is evident that this was not fulfilled upon his apparitions to them after his reſurrection; for then he was not as yet aſcended to the Father, <hi>ch.</hi> 20.17. and the World might ſee him then as well as the diſciples did, ſeeing that he was pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to <hi>Thomas</hi> his hands and fingers, <hi>v.</hi> 25. and viſible to the eyes of the diſciples that were travelling to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luk. 24.15. even whilſt their eyes were as much held from knowing him, as thoſe of the World, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 25, 31. who might therefore ſee him talk with them, and ſit at meat in the houſe, <hi>v.</hi> 30. ſo that this ſeeing him again, and eſpecially becauſe he ſhould go away, muſt needs be meant of that ſight they had on <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> day, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.11, 17. of the comforting Spirit
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40429:108"/>that <hi>ſhewed them plainly of the Father, John</hi> 16.25. and of him therefore, <hi>ch.</hi> 14.9. and that except Chriſts body went away, was not to come, <hi>ch.</hi> 16.7.

Heaven (the heavenly Souls, and not the material Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens that ſhall paſs away, and that cannot contain him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27.) is that which muſt receive him, and where he dwels, (like the Sun in and through the Vegetables, and the Soul in and through all the members of the body) until the time that all things ſhall be reſtored again into the glorious freedom that they had before they fell under the bondage and the curſe of corruption, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21.</p>
               <p>How abſurd it is to think that the Son of any man, or any thing born of fleſh and bloud, as Chriſts body was, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. can ſit in that Majeſty which belongs to God alone, as Chriſt doth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. when fleſh and bloud doth not ſo much as come in that glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. far from ſitting therein
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40429:109"/>in the higheſt place! And to know after the fleſh him that ſaves us from the fleſh; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining us eternal redemption from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. — 7.24. when we muſt not henceforth know him ſo! 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. And to worſhip the Image of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Spirits in the fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. when he is no more to be by us dealt with in the fleſh! <hi>John</hi> 20.17. and ſaith that the fleſh of man, otherwiſe his humane fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing to man, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. but his own true fleſh and bloud, which he had <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> and came down <hi>in tempore</hi> from his ſtillneſs and reſt (his Heaven) to be the bread of life unto all the World! <hi>v.</hi> 51. and which is the Holy Ghoſt, whereby he that eats the ſame ſhall live; how? even as Chriſt himſelf lives by the Father, <hi>v.</hi> 57. which cannot be by eating and drinking of fleſh and bloud: and much leſs by tranſmuting his fleſh in bread to eat it; for bread is eaten only by the fleſh, and quickneth but the fleſhly body alone, <hi>v.</hi> 63. By tranſmuting, I ſay, of fleſh and bloud into bread, and not of bread into fleſh, (as ſome, who heaping non-ſence upon their deep ignorance of God, do, by the exceſs of blind zeal, which
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40429:110"/>uſually men have for idolatry, moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly and ridiculouſly hold, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22, 23, 25, 28.) for as long as we neither ſee, ſmell, nor taſte any fleſh, but ſtill bread as well after as before the pretended miracle of tranſmutation, it cannot be a change of bread into fleſh, but of fleſh into that which remains bread; if ſo be that a change of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were effected, as nothing but their bare word appears for the proof of it: for the Scripture, though this thing deſerves better than many others to be obſerved, takes not the leaſt notice, and makes no mention of it: Secondly, they cannot ſhew a neceſſity for it, but rather contrariwiſe; for what reaſon is there that our fleſh which is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. and can never be ſaved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. and even muſt he <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. and that <hi>maketh imperfect,</hi> Gal. 3.3. and therefore cannot be made perfect, <hi>John</hi> 17.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. that is, <hi>very good,</hi> as man when firſt created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. ſhould be fed and nouriſhed with what gives eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, the fleſh and the bloud of Chriſt; and that this ſhould be therefore turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to common bread, for our fleſh to feed on: And thirdly, no body yet having ever ſeen
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40429:110"/>any fleſh and bloud to become bread, and that the Communion-bread was once fleſh and bloud before this ſtrange tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the miracle pretended to do it is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and if it be inviſible, it is therefore no miracle: for all miracles are wrought to be ſeen, that God may ſhew his power, and that his name may be declared thereby among men throughout the Earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. <hi>John</hi> 9.3. and before the water was turned into bloud or wine, <hi>Lots</hi> wife in Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the water was by ſome taſted and ſeen, and the fleſh of the body of <hi>Lots</hi> wife was ſeen and felt.

I ſay, that he who eats of this fleſh, ſhall live by it; and ſhall by this fleſh and bloud (<hi>the power of our Chriſt, and from on high,</hi> Luk. 24.49. Act. 1.8.) be quickned,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40429:111"/>and ſo ſtrengthned that he ſhall <hi>overcome</hi> the accuſer, or Tempter that tempted <hi>Eve, Rev.</hi> 12.11.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40429:114"/>God buried him,</hi> Deut. 34.6. <hi>in a valley of</hi> Moab, (in the low creeping conceits baſtard Chriſtians have of Chriſt) <hi>over againſt</hi> Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peor, (the houſes of worſhip where ſtiff-necked <hi>Iſrael</hi> falls to commit whoredom, falſhood, and idolatry, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25 1, 3, 18.) to ſhew the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they ſhould not commit whoredom and idolatry, with the body of the true Mediator Jeſus Chriſt; but have far ſublimer and higher conceits of his Spiritual and Eternal kingdom, than other men have, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.1, 2.</p>
               <p>But is not Chriſt become man, (may ſome object unto me) did not he take upon him our fleſh, was he not made like unto us his Brethren; <hi>tempted in all points like we,</hi> Heb. 2.17. — 4.15. and even ſubject to death, and the Mediator ſtill between the ſinner and God? why therefore ſhould we know him no more in his fleſh and bloud?

And <hi>as it is appointed unto all men to dye once,</hi> Chriſt, to bear their ſins, needed <hi>to offer himſelf but once:</hi> and (note well) <hi>he doth appear the ſecond time without ſin, unto them that obey hem,</hi> Heb. 5.9. to perfect <hi>their ſalvation,</hi> ch. 9.27, 28. ſo that having once offered his undefiled body, as the Lamb without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, a ranſom for all the World, both for them that were before and that ſhall be after him, <hi>he needs not take a body often,</hi> v. 25. and dying no more, needs not keep it any more: and alſo, ſince he is now in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, <hi>and is glorified</hi> again <hi>with the glory which he had with God before the World was,</hi> John 17.5. the fleſh that is a burthen which mankind doth groan under, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 4. and made Chriſt here upon earth <hi>uncomely and deſpiſed,</hi> Iſa. 53.2, 3. though ſuppoſed to be made ſince never ſo glorious, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining fleſh and bloud, cannot conſiſt, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.50, 52. with that glorious, infinite, and wonderful Majeſty. Therefore <hi>the Children of the reſurrection ſhall,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.36. <hi>be equal to the Angels,</hi> that they may partake of Chriſts glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſit in his Throne: and what place

Heb. 7.1, 3, 8. and to ſome others, as to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 48.16. and the reſt?
